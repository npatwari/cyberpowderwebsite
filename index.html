        <h1>CyberPowder Fellows Program Spring 2025</h1>

        <!-- subsection -->
        <h2>Program Summary</h2>
        <p>The CyberPowder Fellows Program addresses the problem that wireless experimental research is inherently multidisciplinary, crossing the EE and CS divide; that wireless networking is undergoing rapid technology and regulatory change; and that today’s wireless testbeds are highly sophisticated, which also means they require significant training to use. The Program is led by three professors across EE and CS at the University of Utah, Neal Patwari, Robert Ricci and Kobus Van der Merwe, with support from the <a href="https://www.powderwireless.net/" target="_blank">POWDER platform</a> technical staff. The Program trains students across the wireless stack to perform wireless related research on POWDER, the world’s largest openly-accessible software-defined wireless testbed. POWDER is deployed across the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City and remotely accessible from anywhere in the world.</p>
        
        <p>The CyberPowder Fellows Program consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Weekly <em>research-focused online wireless networking training</em> meetings from January-April, which are a combination of lecture and hands-on labs that fellows complete on the POWDER platform.</li>
            <li>Engagement with fellows and their advisors on <em>research ideation</em> to support them in defining experimentation plans associated with their research objectives.</li>
            <li>A week-long <em>research exploration</em> at the POWDER platform at the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City, during which fellows will work with the platform and its elements and enact the experimental research plan they have defined.</li>
            <li>Continued <em>research support</em> provided by the POWDER technical staff after the formal completion of the program.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>A key component of the CyberPowder Fellows Program is for participants to define a research idea, typically from their graduate research, and develop a plan to perform/evaluate that research on POWDER. Fellows make progress in the execution of that plan during the program, and continue to use POWDER after the program completes.</p>

My research addresses the challenge of coexistence between active systems like 5G communication signals and passive sensors like the microwave radiometers used by NASA's earth observation missions. I am building a drone-based radiometer for collecting real-world data in a wireless research testbed and also developing a digital twin for simulated data acquisition. Combining them we will generate a robust dataset essential for developing powerful interference detection and mitigation algorithms.

The main connectivity issue with UAVs in cellular networks arises from the fact that base station (BS) antennas are typically tilted downward to serve ground users. As a result, UAVs in flight often rely on the side lobes of the BS radiation pattern for connectivity. This leads to fluctuating signal quality and unreliable connections at altitude. The goal of this project is to model side lobe propagation and estimate handover occurrences based on UAV trajectories.

(<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3616388.3617545" target="_blank">paper1</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10615823" target="_blank">paper2</a>) Goal: Detect and identify Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) in radio-astronomical datasets obtained from radio telescopes (passive devices) using machine learning techniques. Passive devices typically get plagued with wireless man-made signals (active devices). Specifically, I have worked on enhancing RFI detection in datasets obtained from the Kitt Peak Telescope at Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO), leveraging semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve classification accuracy while minimizing reliance on large labeled datasets. Next steps: After detecting the RFI, pinpoint the source that caused RFI by characterizing the waveforms.</td>

This project aims to develop a digital twin and AI-integrated framework for accurate spectrum sensing in the CBRS band by predicting site-specific channel state information (CSI). By leveraging a neural network trained on digital twin (DT) computed and real CSI, the system enables precise interference estimation to support intelligent and efficient spectrum utilization.</td>
